# Account Abstraction Cartesi Examples

Account Abstraction can be implemented in several different ways. There are several different Smart Account implementations, services providers and API wrappers.

This repository contains some opinitionated examples:

## permissionless-zerodev

This example uses the [permissionless](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless) API and the [ZeroDev](https://zerodev.app) smart wallet implementation.

The developer can follow the [original documentation](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-kernel-account), taking into account that the Cartesi CLI provides a local bundler and paymaster service.
